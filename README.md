I did not write this tool.

This is an example of libpcap usage in C ripped from Building Open
Source Network Security Tools - Components and Techniques by Mike
D. Schiffman. I've updated the OUI list as of January 2017, made a few
minor formatting changes, and made this available for educational
purposes.

The original book examples can still be downloaded from
http://www.wiley.com//legacy/compbooks/schiffman/

This builds without error on Ubuntu 16.04. You need libpcap installed:

apt install libpcap-dev
